     * What if we want to do better in both addLast() and removeLast()?
     * Set another pointer go backwards, not a singly linked list, but a doubly linked list.
     * However, the sentinel becomes useless. We need more improvements (more detailed implementation is in project 1):
     *
     * 1. Set two sentinels, at the beginning and in the end, going opposite during updating.
     *
     * 2. Set only one sentinel, but make the list circular, with the front and back pointers sharing the
     * same sentinel node. (Might be more aesthetically beautiful)
