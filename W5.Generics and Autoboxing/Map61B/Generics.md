Weâ€™ve seen four new features of Java that make generics more powerful:

1. Autoboxing and auto-unboxing of primitive wrapper types.
2. Promotion/widening between primitive types.
3. Specification of generic types for methods (before return type).
4. Type upper bounds in generic methods (e.g. K extends Comparable<K>).
5. We can also see another feature called "wildcards" later.
