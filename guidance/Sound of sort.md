# Questions to ponder:
1. How many items are sorted in the video for selection sort?
2. Why does insertion sort take longer / more compares than selection sort?
3. At what time stamp does the first partition complete for Quicksort?
4. Could the size of the input used by mergesort in the video be a power of 2?
5. What do the colors mean for heapsort?
6. How many characters are in the alphabet used for the LSD sort problem?
7. How many digits are in the keys used for the LSD sort problem?
