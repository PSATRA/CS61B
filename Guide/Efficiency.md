# Efficiency comes in two flavors:

1. Programming cost.
   - How long does it take to develop your programs?
   - How easy is it to read, modify, and maintain your code?
2. Execution cost (starting next week).
   - How much time does your program take to execute?
   - How much memory does your program require?
