# Why Java?
## Arguably, takes less time to write programs, due to features like:
Static types (provides type checking and helps guide programmer).    
Bias towards interface inheritance leading to cleaner subtype polymorphism.    
Access control modifiers make abstraction barriers more solid.    
## More efficient code, due to features like:
Ability to have more control over engineering tradeoffs.
Single valued arrays lead to better performance.
## Basic data structures more closely resemble underlying hardware:
Would be weird to do ArrayDeque in Python, since there is no need for array resizing. However, in hardware (see 61C), variable length arrays donâ€™t exist.
